Key Features of Python\n","- **Simple & Readable**: Python’s syntax is clear, making it easy to learn and understand.\n","- **Interpreted Language**: Executes code line-by-line, making debugging easier.\n","- **Object-Oriented**: Supports concepts like classes and objects for structured programming.\n","- **Dynamic Typing**: Variable types are determined at runtime, so you don’t need to declare them.\n","- **Extensive Libraries**: Includes modules for web development, data science, AI, etc.\n","- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various operating systems without modification.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Role of Predefined Keywords\n","- **Definition**: Keywords are reserved words in Python with special meanings, like `if`, `else`, `for`, etc.\n","- **Example**:\n","  ```python\n","    if age >= 18:\n","          print(\"Eligible to vote\")\n","            else:\n","                  print(\"Not eligible\")\n","\n","                    ```\n","                     \n","\n","Here, `if` and `else` control the flow based on conditions.\n","\n","                      \n","\n","                    \n","  ### 3. Mutable vs Immutable Objects\n","    \n"," -                \n","**Mutable Objects**: Can change after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).        \n"," ```python\n"," my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","     My_list.append(4)\n"," #my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","              ```\n"," -                      \n","**Immutable Objects**: Cannot change once created (e.g., strings, tuples).                                \n","  ```python\n","       my_str = \"Hello\"\n","        my_str[0] = \"h\"\n","  #raises an error as strings are immutable.  \n","  \n","                         ```\n","\n","                        ---\n","\n","\n","\n","                                      \n","### 4. Types of Operators\n","                            \n"," - **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (e.g., `a + b`).\n"," -\n","  **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<` (e.g., `a == b`).\n"," -\n","   **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not` (e.g., `a > b and b > c`).\n","\n"," -  **Bitwise**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~` (e.g., `a & b`).\n","  ```python\n","         a = 5\n","            b = 3\n","              print(a + b)  # Output: 8\n","                ```\n","           ---\n","                                     \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","                                               \n"," ### 5. Type Casting.\n","\n","  - **Definition**: Converting a variable from one type to another.\n","  - **Example**\n"," ```python\n","                 age = \"25\"\n","                 age = int(age)\n","        # Converts string to integer.\n","        print(age + 5)  # Output: 30\n","         ```\n","          ---\n","\n","                                                         \n"," ### 6. Conditional Statements\n"," -                 \n","  How they Work: Allow decisions in  the code based on conditions.   \n","          \n"," - **Example**:\n","```python\n","        age = 20\n","          if age >= 18:\n","               print(\"Adult\")\n"," else: print(\"Minor\")\n","                         ```                ---\n","\n","                                                                                \n"," ### 7. Types of Loops.\n"," - For Loop: Iterates over a sequence.\n","  \n"," ```python\n","       for i in range(5):\n","       print(i)  # Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n","  ```\n"," -While Loop: Repeats as long as a condition is true.  \n"," ```python\n","      count = 0\n","      while count < 5:\n","       print(count)\n"," count += 1\n","    ```"],"metadata":{"id":"6VpcZYk84lyh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"asgFKh7B_ZAe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
